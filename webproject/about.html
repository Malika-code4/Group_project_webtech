    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Our project was created to help university students balance their academic workload by staying 
      organized and collaborating effectively on both individual and group projects. 
      As students ourselves, we understand the stress of juggling multiple deadlines, assignments, and teamwork.
      <br><br>
      This platform was built to make student life simpler empowering learners to plan, track, and 
      complete their academic goals with confidence and clarity.

      To empower university students to manage their academic workload effectively by providing a 
      simple, collaborative, and efficient task management platform. We aim to reduce stress, 
      enhance productivity, and promote teamwork for better academic success.

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
